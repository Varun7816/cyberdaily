What began as a small group primarily focused on **SIM swapping** and cryptocurrency theft has metastasized into a sophisticated network of specialized teams. This group now poses an unprecedented and immediate risk to major organizations globally, marked by their ability to cause wide-reaching service disruption and massive financial losses. Unlike conventional ransomware groups, their modular structure and diverse skill set enable them to tailor attacks and scale operations with alarming speed."
