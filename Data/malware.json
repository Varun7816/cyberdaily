        "content": "Many assistants let developers attach external files, URLs, or repositories as context. This boosts relevance but also means if that external content is manipulated, the LLM can be manipulated too. Users may inadvertently feed tainted data, enabling stealthy prompt injection."

        "content": "Auto-completion is a double-edged sword. If a prompt or prefix is crafted cleverly, it can coax the model to generate harmful or insecure code—e.g. insert backdoors, open remote connections, or include data exfiltration logic."

        "content": "Some assistants allow direct calls to the base model from the client side, bypassing constraints. Combined with stolen session tokens (a scenario we call **LLMJacking**), adversaries can supply new system prompts and produce malicious outputs. They may even rent or resell access to legitimate model endpoints."

        "content": "1. Always Review Generated Code — Never blindly trust an AI assistant. Use code reviews, static analysis, and manual auditing before executing suggestions.\n2. Sanitize & Vet Context Sources — Before attaching external files, repositories, or URLs as context, vet their integrity. Avoid unknown or untrusted sources.\n3. Limit Auto-Completion in Sensitive Modules — Disable or restrict autocomplete features when working in cryptography, authentication, or networking modules.\n4. Enforce Usage Boundaries — Use prompts that clearly separate system instructions from user inputs. Set usage policies for dynamic system prompts.\n5. Token & Access Protection — Secure session tokens and API keys. Ensure they’re not exposed to client-side code, and rotate them frequently to mitigate misuse.\n6. Adopt Defense-in-Depth for AI Tools — Combine sandboxing, runtime checks, and anomaly detection to monitor for unexpected behavior triggered by AI outputs."

        "content": "As AI coding assistants become more powerful and ubiquitous, attackers will continue finding new vectors—especially via prompt injection and context manipulation. The balance between convenience and security is delicate. Developers must remain vigilant, continuously refine their practices, and never forget: the human in the loop is the last line of defense."
